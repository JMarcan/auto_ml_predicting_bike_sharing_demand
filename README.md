# Predicting Bike Sharing Demand with AutoML library AutoGluon

## Overview
This project was part of Machine Learning Nanodegree from Udacity.<br>
In this project, I used bikesharing data from Kaggle competition <br>
and trained a model predicting demand with AutoML library AutoGluon.

First, I trained the model with AutoGluon on raw data and submitted it to Kaggle for reference score ranking.<br>
Second step was improving performance with feature engineering and training model with new features.<br>
Third step was trying AutoGluon's support for hyperparameters tailoring.<br>
Results are summarized  in the [Project Report](report-template.md).
